/*Write the following declarations and implementations:

Two instance variables: one for your stack , and one for your queue.
A void pushCharacter(char ch) method that pushes a character onto a stack.
A void enqueueCharacter(char ch) method that enqueues a character in the queue  instance variable.
A char popCharacter() method that pops and returns the character at the top of the stack  instance variable.
A char dequeueCharacter() method that dequeues and returns the first character in the queue instance variable.*/
